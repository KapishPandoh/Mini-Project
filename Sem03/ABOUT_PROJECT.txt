In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses dataset. 
Once we get a good fit, we will use this model to predict the monetary value of a house.
A model like this would be very valuable for a real estate agent who could make use of the information provided on  daily basis.
