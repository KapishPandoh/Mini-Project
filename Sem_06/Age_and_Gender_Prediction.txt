# Age and Gender Prediction using CNN

Deep Learning has found huge applications in the fields of Computer vision. 
Some of the most important applications of computer vision are in the fields that deal with facial data. 
Face Detection and recognition are being widely used in security-based applications
The motivation behind this is to build an application for age and gender classification using a model that is suitable for real life predictions. 
Many models are focusing on datasets with constrained faces and are not suitable for in-the-wild estimation. 
In this we will focus on deep learning end-to-end methods.
